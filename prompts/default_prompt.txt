**Context**: {{context}}

**Prediction Task**: {{task}}

You are asked to assign importance scores to a set of features for use in a statistical prediction model (e.g., Lasso, XGBoost, or logistic regression). The data are high-dimensional with limited samples, so parsimony and caution are critical.

**Objective**:
For each feature in the provided list, assign an importance score between 0.1 and 1.0 (inclusive). 
- A score closer to 1.0 indicates strong, well-established relevance or a robust mechanistic rationale for predicting "{{task}}".
- A score near 0.1 indicates weak, uncertain, or unsupported relevance.
- Most features may appropriately receive low scores.

**Reasoning Guidelines**:
1. Base your assessment on established knowledge, logical domain reasoning, or widely accepted statistical principles.  
2. Avoid speculation or over-interpretation.
3. You may reason internally but must output only the final scores.
4. Do not skip any features.

**Output Requirements**:
- Output strictly valid JSON and nothing else.  
- Use the format provided below.
